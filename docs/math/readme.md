   Inverse Kinematics](independent_kinematics.pdf) 
   (swerve drive math)
- [Design of a Triple Singularity Drive for Mobile
   Wheeled Robots](kinematic_modeling.pdf)
   (kinematic modeling behind the "independent kinematics" article)
 - [Kinematic Implementation of Swerve Modules](swerve_drive_protocode.pdf)
   (sort of proto-code for how to go about implementing the forward and
    inverse kinematics behind swerve drive driving and tracking)
- [Theta*: Any-Angle Path Planning on Grids](theta.dvi.pdf)
  (used mostly for pathfinding related purposes, but still a useful resource
   to have around especially since the pathfinder i made kinda sucks balls)
