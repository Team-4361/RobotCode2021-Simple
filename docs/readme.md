# Documentation Hub
In an effort to make coding more accessible to anyone who's never seen FRC
or 4361 code, I've created (or at least tried to create, or will try to
create) a hub for all the documentation related to this project.
- [elibs2](elibs2/readme.md) (start here if you have FRC experience)
- [ezpos](ezpos/readme.md) (positional tracking)
- [pathfinder](pathfinder/readme.md) (2d ThetaStar pathfinding and mapping)
- [quickstart](quickstart/readme.md) (start here if you're new to FRC)
- [vision](vision/readme.md) (everything vision related)
- [math](math/readme.md) (everything math related (ie kinematics and geom))
